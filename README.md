## Introduction

Pool Rides is a ride sharing application similar to that of Uber and Lyft. The business model for Pool Rides differs from the aforementioned application as Pool Rides draw is its personalized ride experience for every user. Utilizing user preferences, interests, and hobbies, the service matches users with drivers of similar interests. Through this model, the users of Pool Rides will no longer need to worry about ride sharing with complete strangers. Effectively eliminating the “Dont talk to me” environment so common amongst Uber and Lyft rides.
